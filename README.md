# Exoterium

A webapp project aims to provide a platform where high school students can easily understand what researchers are currently doing.
this platform will help them to:

1. Feel easier in choosing their future undergraduate majors.

2. Be more inspired in expressing their interest about the majors that they applied for in their ps.

3. Achieve a broader view on current science.

'Exoterium', means 'exoteric academic place'. I'm thinking about its Chinese name.
