# Exoterium

the ultimate aim of my project is to provide a platform where high school students can easily understand what are researchers are currently doing.
this platform will help them to be
	1. easier in choosing their future undergraduate majors
	2. more inspired in expressing their interest about the majors that they applied for in their ps
	3. have a broader view on current science
the name of my project is 'Exoterium', which means 'exoteric academic place'
